            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p> A three-page personal blog built with HTML5 and CSS3. Features original posts, multiple forms, and a responsive layout for various devices. </p>
            <h2> My Role</h2>
            <p> As the designer and developer of this website, I was responsible for the entire process from concept to deployment.</p>
            <h2 class="after-image">Goals</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of this project was to create a personal blog site where I could share my thoughts and experiences. I intended to create a visually appealing and readable layout with easy navigation. The blog needed to be responsive, ensuring an smooth experience across different devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. I also wanted to experiment with color-coded sections and a sticky tab to enhance user experience and blog organization.
            </p>
            <h2> Concept </h2>
            <p>
                I wanted to use a light and airy color scheme to create a welcoming, lighthearted atmosphere for readers. I'm partial to both blue and stars, so I incorporated various shades of blue along with a pastel yellow reminiscent of stars. The typography choices of Merriweather for body text and Patua One for headings were made to ensure readability and a modern aesthetic. The layout was designed to be organized, with clear distinctions between different blog posts and sections. I also implemented a sticky tab on the side for easy navigation to blog posts, enhancing the overall user experience.
            </p>

            <h2> Design Process </h2>
            <p>
                The design process began with taking inspiration from a past website prototype I created in Figma. Originally meant as a portfolio site, I adapted several design elements to fit the blog format. I spent a significant amount of time refining the spacing and layout of the pages to prevent a cluttered appearance. However, my biggest challenge was adapting the design to be responsive. The initial desktop design did not translate well to mobile devices, leading to issues with overlapping elements and difficult navigation. To address this, I created separate designs for tablet and mobile views, realigning elements and adjusting font sizes.

            <h2> Link to Live Site </h2>
            <a href="https://sampleblogpb.netlify.app/">
                <button class="site-link"> Click here</button>
            </a>

            <h2>Features & Highlights</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Sticky "Recent Posts" tab </li>
                <li> Color-coded blog sections for easy navigation </li>
                <li> Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile </li>
                <li> Newsletter signup form </li>
                <li> Utilizes many HTML5 elements </li>
            </ul>
            <h2> Conclusion </h2>
            <p> 
                This personal blog project allowed me to enhance my skills in HTML5 and CSS3 while exploring responsive design techniques. The final product is a visually appealing and user-friendly blog that effectively showcases my writing and design abilities. I am proud of the cohesive color scheme, typography choices, and overall layout that contribute to an enjoyable reading experience. If I were to further develop this project, I would consider adding interactive features such as comment sections or likes to engage readers more actively.
