            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p> Concept and narrative design for Echoes Between, featuring story maps, world-building, and concept art for characters and environments on a tidally locked planet. Shortened summaries for portfolio purposes.</p>
            <h2> My Role</h2>
            <p> I developed all concept art, narrative planning, and story structure for this project, including character design, environmental concepts, and more.
            <h2 class="after-image">Goals</h2>
            <p>
                The goals of this project were to create a cohesive fictional world suited for a video game. I wanted to design unique characters with depth, and who fit into the game world. Alongside this, I had to decide on a title, a detailed story map, and important gameplay elements. Overall, I aimed to design a realistic and intriguing video game concept.
            </p>
            <h2> Concept </h2>
            <p>
                On a planet split between darkness and light, a growing imbalance threatens to destroy it all. Journey across the fractured realms, uncovering forgotten truths, in order to mend the divide.
            </p>
            <p>
                Echoes Between follows Nyra Orlith, a scout from the shadowed region of Umbraeth. Haunted by visions of collapse and driven by her severed connection to the spirit realm, Nyra must navigate dangerous terrains and divided societies to uncover the source of the imbalance. Her path crosses with Aeris Lucent, a determined agriculturist from Ignisca, the sunlit side of the planet. Together, they must uncover ancient secrets and confront their societies’ generational divide—or their homelands might not make it.

            <h2> Conclusion </h2>
            <p> 
                This project strengthened my ability to combine visual development with narrative design. I learned how to build a unique world that feels culturally and environmentally coherent, while designing characters and story structures rooted in that world. Moving forwards, I'd expand the story map into a full narrative script and develop more concept art.
