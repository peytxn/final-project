            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p> A space-themed game UI for Cosmosis, including title, pause, settings (with accessibility options), and inventory screens. Clear, usable, and immersive.</p>
            <h2> My Role</h2>
            <p> As the sole designer, I researched space-themed aesthetics and UI best practices, created mockups in Figma, and iterated based on feedback to ensure usability and visual appeal. The background images were sourced from copyright-free image sites.</p>
            <h2 class="after-image">Goals</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of this project was to design a visually cohesive and user-friendly game UI. Menus needed to be readable and intuitive during gameplay, and multiple screens were required to cover different game states. Additionally, I aimed to incorporate accessibility features to accommodate a wider range of players.
            </p>
            <h2> Concept </h2>
            <p>
                I was allowed to choose any game concept for this UI design. I decided on a space exploration theme, as I enjoy sci-fi aesthetics and felt it would allow for interesting visual elements. The design incorporates dark, metallic-inspired backgrounds with bright accent colors to evoke the feeling of space technology while ensuring text and icons stand out for readability. The font choices were especially important, as they needed to fit the theme while remaining clear at various sizes. Furthermore, I included accessibility options in the settings menu, such as text size adjustment and colorblind modes, to enhance usability for all players.

            <h2> Conclusion </h2>
            <p> 
                This UI project allowed me to explore game interface design while balancing aesthetics and usability. I enhanced my skills in Figma and learned the importance of accessibility in game design. Through iterative feedback, I was able to create an interface supporting both immersion and player needs. If I were to further develop this project, I would adjust certain elements based on user feedback to optimize the overall experience.
